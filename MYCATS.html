            Mika is a six month old Scottish Fold. He is a very energetic and playful kitten. He LOVES running around with his ball. 
            He does not know how to meow yet so he screams instead. He loves to bang on doors in the middle of the night and has learned to open them.
            Mika also purrs NONSTOP. We call him a motorcycle.
